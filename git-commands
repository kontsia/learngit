------------ Section 2 ------------
A useful url for how commits are looked like in git time-line: http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/#zen

git branch feature1 --> creates a new branch with name feature1 BUT YOU DONT SWITCH TO IT!!!
git checkout feature1 --> switch to branch named "feature1"

git checkout -b feature2 --> creates a new branch named "feature2" and SWITCH to it at the same time !!!!

origin/master:
Origin and Master are two different terminologies used when working and managing the git projects. Origin is the name used for the remote repository. Master is the name of the branch

origin/HEAD:
origin/HEAD is the active branch on the remote repo.

HEAD -> master:
Means that the HEAD is pointing to master branch

HEAD -> feature1:
Means that the HEAD is pointing to branch named "feature1"


------------ Section 3 ------------
git merge repo1 --> means that: If you are in a branch named "branch0) you will merge INTO IT, the changes of branch1
Example1: You are in main branch and you want to merge branch "feature1"
		git checkout main
		git merge feature1
Example2: You are in "feature1" branch and you want to merge branch "feature2"
		git checkout feature1
		git merge feature2

ATTENTION: 	Let's say that we are on branch "feature1" and we have merged "feature2" into "feature1".
		If we make a cnage/commit on branch "feature1" and we want to switch to the (merged) "feature2, every change we did on the "feature1 (the previous branch), will be lost...!!!!!


ADVICE:		Once we're done merging, we should delete the "merged" branch !!!
